LSN_exercises_delivery


Possible problems:
- N.B. When executing one of the the simulations (in exercise07), 
  I incurred in the error:

	*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated
	Aborted (core dumped)

  A `make clean` fixed it. It could be a good idea to give a `make clean`
  before compiling with `make` anyway, just in case!
