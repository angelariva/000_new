Course of Numerical Simulation Laboratory,
held by Professor Davide E. Galli
Universit√† degli Studi di Milano
Physics faculty

These are my projects. In the directory "buildingblocks" one can find 
the code provided in the classroom and the assignments of the exercises.
I used a lot of that code to build my own programs, that can be 
found in the directories 'exercise01' etc. For the comments in the jupyter
notebooks I heavily relied on the lecture notes of the same course.

In each directory you can find a README that explains how to compile & execute 
the programs. Each program corresponds to one of the mandatory exercise of the 
laboratory course.

Possible problems:

- N.B.	When executing one of the the simulations (in exercise07), 
	I incurred in the error:

	*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated
	Aborted (core dumped)

	A `make clean` fixed it. It could be a good idea to give a `make clean`
	before compiling with `make` anyway, just in case!
  
- N.B.	When running the programs (in the scripts, e.g. 'ex1.sh') I usually
	preventively deleted the old results. If one desires to keep them, 
	I suggest changing the names of the directories where they are stored
	from 'results' to 'results_backup' or something like that.

- N.B.	In some exercises there are requirements/external libraries to be
	installed; I have specified what is needed in the related README files.
