From shell, inside _this_ directory:
- to compile: `make`;
- to run: `./ex1.sh`.

If one wants to run the program independently the usage is:

`./main [Npop] [Ngen] [shape]`


The (mandatory) options to be inserted from command line are:
- `[Npop]`:  # of individuals in the first generation; 
-  `[Ngen]`:  # of generations; 
- `[shape]`: shape of the world. The only two possibilities are:
    - circumference; 
    - square.
