From shell, inside _this_ directory:
- to compile: `make`;
- to run the first exercise: `./ex1.sh`;
- to run the second exercise: `./ex1.sh`.

To run the first program run from shell:

	./main [Ntemp] [Nstep] [shape] 

This program solves the Travelling SalesMan Problem using Genetic Algorithm. 
The (mandatory) options to be inserted from command line are: 
	 [Ntemp]:  # of temperatures to be considered; 
	 [Nstep]:  # of steps to be made for each temperature; 
	 [shape]: shape of the world. The only two possibilities are: 
		  - circumference; 
 		  - square.

**NB: `mpi.h` libraries need to be installed to run the second program!**
To run the second program independently, run from shell, inside `ex10.2` directory:

	mpirun --use-hwthread-cpus  ./main [Npop] [Ngen] [shape]
