From shell, inside _this_ directory:
- to compile all the programs: `make`;
- to run the fist program: `./ex1.sh`;
- to run the second program (**[ROOT](https://root.cern/)** 
  is needed to compile & run): `./ex3.sh`.

If you don't have ROOT installed on your computer, it is possible 
to compile only the first program by giving the command `make` inside 
the `ex8.1` directory. To execute the first program you can then l
aunch the script `./ex1.sh`.
