From shell, inside _this_ directory:
- To compile: `make`
- To run the program there are several options:

USAGE: ./main [option1] [options2]

EXAMPLE 1: ./main --pos+rad 1.22 2.94 1.5 3.7
EXAMPLE 2: ./main --far 1.22 2.94 1.5 3.7

OPTION 1:
        --help        to print out this help message;

        --pos         to print on file the positions sampled;
        --rad         to print on file the average radius;
        --pos+rad     to print on file the pos sampled & av radius;
        --far         to print on file the pos sampled from a position
                      far, far away from the origin.

OPTIONs 2, in the following order:

      [step100unif] [step210unif] [step100gaus] [step210gaus]

      Double values to set the STEP of:

      [step100unif]:  ground state distribution with uniform transition
                      probability;
      [step210unif]:  first excited state distribution with uniform transition
                      probability;
      [step100gaus]:  ground state distribution with gaussian transition
                      probability;
      [step210gaus]:  first excited state distribution with gaussian transition
                      probability.
