From shell, inside `/code` directory:
- To compile: `make`;

From shell, inside _this_ directory:
- To run the first program: `./equilibration.sh`;
- To run the second program (it takes a while): `./ex1.sh`.

The scripts provided should take care of everything. 
The scripts set also the values of the input file. 
To change the input values the best option could be 
to modify the scripts themselves. The two programs 
are independent and can be executed in whatever order.
