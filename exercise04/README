From shell, inside _code_ directory:
- N.B. When executing the simulation, I incurred in the error:

	*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated
	Aborted (core dumped)

  A `make clean` fixed it. It could be a good idea to give a `make clean`
  anyway, just in case!
- To compile: `make`

To obtain the results required in the exercise, from shell,
inside _this_ directory:
- To execute the first program: `./ex1.sh`
- To execute the second program: `./ex2.sh`

There's no need of changing the input files or creating new directories:
the scripts provided should take care of everything. The scripts set also
the values of the input file. To change the input values the best option
could be to modify the scripts themselves.

Inside the _code_ directory it is also possible to run independent simulations.
You can modify the parameters of these simulations by changing the file
input.dat.

To run the first simulation:

./main --equilibration input.dat

Then the next simulations can be performed with:

./main --restart input.dat

When the system is equilibrated (some restarts will be needed), you can run
a final --restart with a big number of sample points.
